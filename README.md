# NEXTLINK - MACHINE LEARNING REPO

## Description
This repository contains the code and resources for training machine learning text classification model, scheduling algorithm, and feedback learning for Nextlink application. The repository divided into 3 folders, that is notebook as it is contain all of ipynb files, model which contains all the saved and exported model and components, and dataset.

## Installation
To run this repository you will need dependencies and libraries as in the requirements.txt file

`pip install -r requirements.txt`



We developed a text classification model and scheduling algorihtm (CPM) that classify task and generate timeline based on the task. The purpose of this model is to create a project planning for project manager, offering a quick decision making project planning app.
